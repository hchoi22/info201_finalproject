# Story Pitch
## What is the story you intend to tell and visualize? 
In recent years, there have been consistent concerns over decreasing birth rate all over the world including the United States. This has led to people to predict job opportunities relating to elementary and middle school education to decrease as the population distribution starts to become older and older. Along with this change, there was another change that has been going on in the field of education relating to the number of teachers. According to an article by McKinsey&Company, the retention rates of the teachers in the United States have decreased over the past consecutive years. At the same time, over the past decade, the teacher turnover rate has been over 8% which is more than a double of the criteria for Title 1 Funding. This led to a conclusion to realize that the quality of the US education is decreasing along with the decreasing number of teachers in the US Education system. Based on this trend, our group is aiming to describe the impact of the quality of the teachers on student achievement in K-12 schools located in Washington State. To describe this impact, we are going to create a visualization that first show overall lack of teachers in many schools, decreasing quality of the teachers, and the deteriorating academic performances of students in Grade 4 and Grade 8 which fall in the range of K-12 grades. 


## Why is this an interesting and compelling story? 
This is an interesting and compelling story because of its focus on aging population and education disparity. As stated above, aging population is definitely an issue. As the population age, the working population would get smaller and smaller over time. Although it is important to solve this problem with aging population, the education of such younger generation also becomes an important issue to have our eyes on. Our visualization puts light in this issue to urge for more recognition in this problem where the number of teachers, quality of the teachers, and the academic achievement of the students are decreasing. In addition to this interesting aspect to our project, our project also puts into recognition of education disparity where students with low income are not getting as much of quality education as students with high income. Although there may be a difference in amount of money used in education by families, at least in public schools, the education that they receive should relatively be consistent. Our story brings in this compelling idea of education disparity in connection to stressing the importance on the need of quality education in young children in K-12 schools. 


# Finding Data 
Our group has collected a total of 5 different data sets from two different sources. We will be describing our data sets based on its sources. 
## Source 1: OSPI 
The first 3 data sets are from the organization called the OSPI, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. Our group has gathered three data sets from this source that shows a summary of Teacher Qualification for the Washington State over the course of three different academic years starting from 2019-20 til 2021-22. The data sets are collected by gathering different information relating to teacher qualifications for a particular school year. The data sets all have the same information that is each separated by school, district, educational service district and the state level.There are a total of 31 features in the 3 data sets. However, the number of observations differ by the school years where the data for 2021-22 has 200920 observations, the data for 2020-21 has 203169 observations, and the data for 2019-20 has 205336 observations. Each observation indicates the teacher qualification summary of a particular teacher who is working for a school in the State of Washington.

## Source 2: The Nation’s Report Card 
Our group have also collected two additional data sets presented by The Nation’s Report Card. These two data sets include information about the academic achievement of students in two different grades who are attending schools located in the Washington state. The data set has gathered this information from U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics, and National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)Assessment in order to display the changes in academic performance of students over the course of years until 2022. Our group will be using a one data set that shows an academic performance of students in Grade 4 and another data set that displays an academic performance of students in Grade 8. The data set for Grade 4 and Grade 8 both has 13 variables. However, the data set for Grade 4 has 28 observations whereas the data set for Grade 8 has 30 observations. Each observation indicates for an average score of a national assesment’s score for a single subject test in a particular year.

# Background Research/Inspiration

## 1. [K–12 teachers are quitting. What would make them stay?](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/k-12-teachers-are-quitting-what-would-make-them-stay)
### Similarity 
* This article discusses a similar ideas in terms of the increasing turnover rates of the teachers. It is similar with our ideas that is concerned about this recent trend. It is also similar in a way that we both consider the decrease in the education achievements made by the students 
### Differences 
* This article puts more focus on the reasons behind why the teachers are leaving. They specifically mention compensation as a big part of this reason. 
## 2. [Pandemic Prompts Historic Decline in Student Achievement on Nation’s Report Card](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2022-10-24/pandemic-prompts-historic-decline-in-student-achievement-on-nations-report-card)
### Similarity 
* It is similar to our project idea in terms of the decrease in student achievement that we aim to discuss in our project. 
### Differences 
* Unlike ours that puts a focus specifically on Washington state, this article focuses on differences in academic achievement between races. 
## 3. [Washington state teacher resignations at highest level in three decades](https://www.king5.com/article/news/education/washington-state-teacher-turnover/281-57ef0284-9a6b-4d04-a3b0-68efcba2675c#:~:text=According%20to%20OSPI%2C%20in%20a,a%207%25%20teacher%20turnover%20rate)  
### Similarity 
* It is similar to our project in a way that the article discusses the sudden increase in Washington state teacher resignments over the past 30 years. Our project also puts a strong focus on the increasing turn-over rates of the teachers. 
### Differences 
* It is different to our project’s idea in a way that it considers the valuation of the teachers as a key factor to this turnover rate. It is more of personal subjectiveness on whether they feel like they are treated properly and professionally in their profession. We are aiming to focus more deeply on the income differences and the families of the students, and the overall trend rather than the perspective of the teachers. 
## 4. [THE IMPACT OF TEACHER RETENTION ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A4280/datastream/OBJ/view/impact_of_teacher_retention_on_student_achievement_in_high_school_mathematics.pdf ) 
### Similarity
* This particular article discusses the impact of teacher retention on student achievement in high school mathematics and is very similar to the dataset that we are analyzing for our project. 
### Differences
* It is quite different from the dataset we are trying to analyze for our project proposal as it focuses on numerous aspects, yet only for high school students, whereas, we are looking to analyze the differences between all grades in school.
## 5. [How Teacher Turnover Harms Student Achievement](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/Ronfeldt-et-al.pdf)
### Similarity
* This project is almost the exact same as the one we are planning to investigate as a team, and discusses the ways in which teacher turnover directly harms student achievement.
### Difference
* The difference between our project proposal and this particular study is that it investigates the achievement only in New York city for only 4th and 5th graders, whereas our project invesitgates further studies for grades 4 and 8 and focuses solely on Washington State.
